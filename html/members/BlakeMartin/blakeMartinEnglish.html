	  <h3>BLAKE MARTIN</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born and raised in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, Blake Martin began his musical studies as member of the senior choir at his local elementary school. Blake experimented with the clarinet, trombone and electric bass before discovering the double bass in his last year of high school. Blake received orchestral training for the first time with the Ottawa Youth Orchestra Academy under John Gomez. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blake did his undergraduate degree in performance at the University of Ottawa. There he studied with Robert Aldridge currently with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra, as well as with John Geggie (Thirteen Strings) and Maestro David Currie. In his final year, Blake was a member of the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra for the 2011-2012 season. He then completed a Masters of Music degree in performance at the Manhattan School of Music, where he studied with Jeremy McCoy (Assistant Principal Bass of the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra). Performing with the MSM Symphony under Maestro Leonard Slatkin at Carnegie Hall was a major highlight.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent summers, Blake has been a principal member of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada. There he received further instruction from Edward Tait, formerly of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Blake continues to perform with groups in the Ottawa Valley and Montreal regions. In his free time he enjoys nature, hockey, and good food from all over the world.</p>
