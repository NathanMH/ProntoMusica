                    <h3>YOLANDA BRUNO</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian violinist Yolanda Bruno has been praised for "total control of her instrument, articulation and perfect intonation with infinite variety in the sound palette" (La Presse)</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yolanda has been the recipient of numerous awards and scholarships, most recently the OSM Standard Life Grand Prize. Her concerts in North America and Europe include solo performances with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, London Mozart Players, and a tour with Youth Orchestras of the Americas.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent recitals include performances on CBC’s “CBC/McGill Next! Young Artist Series”, Espace Musique as well as BBC Radio 3 and was named in CBC’s 30 Hot Canadian Classical Musicians under 30 list in 2014. In the UK Yolanda has performed in the Barbican Hall, St. Martin in the Fields and for the IMS Open Chamber Music series in Prussia Cove.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A devoted chamber musician, Yolanda performs as first violinist of the UK based Hieronymus Quartet which has embarked on a 2-year-long project covering Beethoven’s complete works for string quartet. Other projects in 2015 include performances with Jordanian pianist, Karim Said; the complete cycle of Beethoven sonatas for violin and piano will be performed at the Purcell School in London as part of a short lecture series offered prior to each performance. She has worked as concertmaster under Gustavo Dudamel and was recently invited to lead the Youth Orchestra of the Americas during their Caribbean tour in July 2014. Yolanda has also collaborated with Levon Chilingirian, Pinchas Zukerman, Menahem Pressler and Arvid Engegård.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yolanda holds a Bachelor of Music degree from McGill University where she studied with Jonathan Crow as a recipient of the Lloyd Carr Harris scholarship. She is also on scholarship at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama where she is completing her postgraduate studies with Mr. David Takeno; she is a recipient of the Sylva Gelber Career Development Award and has been supported by the Canada Council for the Arts. Yolanda is grateful for the support she has received from Canadian institutions and individuals.</p>
