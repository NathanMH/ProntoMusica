	  <h3>ANDREW LAWRENCE</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Double bassist Andrew Lawrence hails from Ottawa, Ontario, where he began his musical education. He discovered his passion for orchestral music during his undergraduate degree at the University of Ottawa, where he studied with David Currie, Joel Quarrington, and John Geggie. He continued his development with a Certificate in Orchestral Studies from the U. of O. in 2012, after which he came to Montreal to take his Masters degree at McGill, which he completed in 2014 with Brian Robinson.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An active orchestral musician, Andrew has performed with many orchestras in concert halls across Canada and overseas. In 2012 and 2013, Andrew was an apprentice in the National Arts Centre Orchestras Institute for Orchestral Studies, during which he performed concerts with the NAC Orchestra in collaboration with distinguished soloists, including Lang Lang, Pinchas Zukerman, and Johannes Moser, among others. Over the course of his studies, he has been a member of various orchestral training programs, including the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, Montreals Orchestre de la Francophonie, the Brott Festivals National Academy Orchestra, and the Grieg Academy Chamber Orchestra in Bergen, Norway.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since completing his studies at McGill, Andrew has been dividing his time as a free-lance bassist between Montreal and Ottawa. He performs regularly with the Ottawa Symphony Orchestra, of which he has been a member since 2008, including a yearly programme of concerts designed to introduce fifth- and sixth-grade children from underprivileged schools to the instruments and sounds of the orchestra. In addition to his enthusiasm for orchestral performance, Andrew is also passionate about composition. He has written and performed duets for double bass with both violin and piano, and has had other original compositions performed for woodwind and brass instruments.</p>
