		    <h3>BETH SILVER</h3>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since beginning her cello studies at the age of four, Beth Silver studied with Wendy Smith, Barbara Pepper, Simon Fryer, Rachel Mercer and Shauna Rolston at the University of Toronto, where she received the Gregor Piatigorsky Scholarship. Currently, Beth is a Master of Music scholarship candidate at McGill University in Montreal under the tutelage of Matt Haimovitz.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A native of Toronto, Beth has received numerous awards from the Royal Conservatory of Music, the York Region Arts Council, and the Kiwanis Festival.  She is the 2014 recipient of the Ben Steinberg Musical Legacy Award, recognizing musical achievement in the Canadian Jewish community.  Beth has performed in festivals across Canada, the United States and Israel, where she has had the privilege to take part as a solo musician, chamber artist, as well as an orchestral player.  </p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having an interest in a variety of genres, she is enthusiastic about her role in many new music projects including contemporary operas, playing with jazz and folk musicians, and incorporating other media into performances.  Having a love for working with children, she is a regular programmer of children’s concerts, some of which include a young people’s concert at Roy Thompson Hall and concerts for Ottawa Chamber Fest.  Beth performs regularly in the greater Toronto area as a soloist and chamber musician, and is excited about her prospects in Montreal that have emerged over the past two years.</p>
