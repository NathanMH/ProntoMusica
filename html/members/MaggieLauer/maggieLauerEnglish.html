	  <h3>MAGGIE LAUER</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maggie Lauer enjoys a multifaceted career combining her two passions of performance and education.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 19, she made her orchestral soloist debut under the baton of Pierre Boulez performing his 套.explosante fixe. Shortly after she was asked to perform for both Steve Reich and Elliot Carter痴 birthday celebrations and to collaborate on performances with members of Bang on a Can on their self-entitled marathon festival in New York City. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Lauer is an active orchestral musician, regularly performing with the DCINY Orchestra, Canadian Chamber Orchestra of NYC, The National Cathedral Orchestra, and All Points West Chamber Ensemble, among others. She has also performed and toured with the Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal (OSM) as a substitute flutist. She was also a concerto soloist with the Montreal based Pronto Musica performing Denis Gougeon痴 Concerto for Four Flutes this past 2013-2014 season.  She has also been a touring flutist with the pop group Il Divo.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only can Ms. Lauer be heard performing Andrew Violette痴 Flute Sonata on the Innova Label, but also on NPR radio performing at Carnegie Hall with the OSM on tour.  </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to her active performance schedule, Maggie Lauer is a sought after teacher. She is a teaching artist with both the Los Angeles Philharmonic Youth Orchestras and New York based non-profit Cultures in Harmony, and a chamber music coach with the Washington DC Youth Orchestra.  Previously, she has held posts at the McGill Conservatory, the Bronx Charter School for the Arts, and the Sheridan School in Washington D.C.  </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A graduate of the Manhattan School of Music, McGill University, and the Universite de Montreal, Ms. Lauer studied with soloist Linda Chesis and Denis Bluteau of the OSM. She is currently completing a music education degree at McGill University.</p>
