          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emerging Canadian flutist Lara Deutsch is a versatile soloist, orchestral and chamber musician based in Montreal, Quebec. She is currently the Principal Flute of the Pronto Musica Chamber Orchestra and has performed with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the Thirteen Strings Chamber Orchestra, the Niagara Symphony Orchestra, the National Academy Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, the Banff Festival Orchestra and l'Orchestre de la francophonie.  A passionate competitor, Lara was a first prize winner of the Montreal Symphony Orchestras 2014 Standard Life Competition, at which she was awarded a total of seven prizes.  Additionally, she was the Grand Prize Winner of both the National Arts Centre Bursary Competition (2014) and the Canadian Music Competition (2010).  In recognition of her promise, Lara was a past recipient of the Astral Artist Prize and of the Salsinger-Tani Gold Medal for Excellence in Performance. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a recitalist, Lara has appeared in concert halls in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Germany and Austria, frequently collaborating with pianists Philip Chiu and Fred Lacroix.  Recent engagements have included recitals sponsored by the Canadian Federation of University Women and by the National Arts Centre, where she was invited to play in January 2013 following her participation in the NACs 2011 Young Artists Program.   She has also had the pleasure of appearing as a concerto soloist with numerous ensembles, notably with the National Arts Centre Orchestra, the McGill Symphony and the Ottawa Chamber Orchestra.   </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of her performing career, Lara is active in her musical community, particularly in support of El Sistema-inspired programs which provide free music education for children in disadvantaged areas.  She was among the first volunteers with the Leading Note Foundations OrKidstra program as well as with the Montreal Heart of the City Piano Program, of which she was Fundraising Director from 2009-2012. </p>
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lara is a graduate of McGill University, where she completed both her Masters (2014) and Bachelors (2012) degrees on full scholarship under the tutelage of Timothy Hutchins and Denis Bluteau.</p>
