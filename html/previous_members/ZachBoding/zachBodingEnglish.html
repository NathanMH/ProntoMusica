		    <h3>ZACH BÖDING</h3>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Known for his expressive and charismatic playing, American oboist Zachary Boeding enjoys an exciting performing career throughout the United States and Canada as an orchestral, solo, and chamber musician.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zachary has been heard as Principal Oboist of Boston’s Discovery Ensemble, and also performed with the Kansas City and Bay Atlantic Symphonies, Symphony in C, and the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra, under the batons of celebrated conductors such as Charles Dutoit, Hugh Wolff, James Levine, Leonard Slatkin, Michael Stern, and Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zachary was a finalist for the Second Oboe position with Canada’s National Arts Centre Orchestra in Ottawa, ON, and for Principal Oboe with the Nashville Symphony. He was also a semi-finalist for a one-year Second Oboe position with the Saint Louis Symphony.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comfortable as a soloist, Zachary has appeared on stage playing concerti of Haydn, Hertel, and Vivaldi, as well as performed English horn in Sibelius’s Swan of Tuonela with the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zachary performs regular recitals in Montréal, Boston, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Kansas City, his hometown. He has appeared in venues such as the Washington D.C.’s Kennedy Center Millennium Stage, and Boston’s Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum and Jordan Hall. Zachary was also invited to play Elliott Carter’s Inner Song from Trilogy for solo oboe by Philadelphia’s Network for New Music. His wind quintet, Ventus, also played a solo recital in Boston’s Jordan Hall, where they premiered Tres Poemas by composer Andreia Pinto-Correia.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A dedicated performer of contemporary music, Zachary worked closely with composer Yehudi Wyner for a performance of his Oboe Quartet, which was received with acclaim by the New York Times; and recorded the English Horn part for John Zorn’s violin concerto Contes de Fées. In addition, he has premiered new works with groups such as Boston Musica Viva, Boston’s New Music Initiative, Center City Opera, and the Peabody Essex Museum’s Encounters Ensemble.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zachary realized his passion for working with young musicians through Discovery Ensemble’s outreach curriculum. He aims to help each student find their own voice, musical or non, by teaching private lessons and coaching chamber music, in addition to performing numerous outreach concerts per year.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently based in Montréal, Zachary is a Schulich Scholar at McGill University under the tutelage of Theodore Baskin and Jacqueline Leclair. He earned his bachelor’s degree from New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, where he studied with John Ferrillo, principal oboist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.  Zachary has also worked extensively with Anne Gabrielle, Jonathan Blumenfeld, Barbara Bishop, and Daniel Stolper.</p>
