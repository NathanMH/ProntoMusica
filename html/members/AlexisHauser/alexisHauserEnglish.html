There he received the Leonard Bernstein Scholarship and has been awarded the Koussevitzky Conducting Prize by the Boston Symphony. He made his US debut as guest conductor with the Atlanta Symphony and at the New York City Opera in 1975.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since then Hausers international guest conducting schedule has included some of the worlds renown orchestras, such as Vienna Symphony, Rotterdam Philharmonic, Radio Philharmonic Hilversum, Radio Symphony Berlin, South West German Radio Symphony, Tchaikovsky Symphony Moscow (with whom he recorded Bruckners Ninth Symphony), Orchestre National Toulouse; Bruckner Orchestra Linz, Czech Philharmonic Brno, Enescu Philharmonic Bucharest, Budapest Symphony, the Philharmonics of Belgrade, Zagreb, Ljubljana and Krakow as well as the major symphonies in Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Minnesota, Rochester, Montreal, Toronto and Mexico City; Hauser also conducted at Chicago's Grant Park Festival, Washington Opera, Opera Midwest Chicago, and in Finland, Norway and Iceland.
