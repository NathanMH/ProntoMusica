	  <h3>KRISJANA THORSTEINSON</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Krisjana Thorsteinson is a freelance oboist in the province of Quebec, currently residing in Montreal. Since her arrival, she completed her Master's degree in Oboe Performance in 2013. She has performed with many local orchestras, most notably with l'Orchestre Métropolitain under the baton of Yannick Nézet-Séguin, and is engaged regularly with l'Orchestre Symphonique de l'Estuaire under Luc Chaput.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A native of California, she completed her undergraduate degree in Oboe Performance at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music in 2010. She has played in Davies Symphony hall with the 11-time Grammy Award winning San Francisco Symphony on multiple occasions as second oboe and solo English Horn. She was principle oboe with the Magik*Magik Orchestra, a modular orchestra which accompanies popular musicians such as Sting, Chicago, Death Cab for Cutie and the Dodos and has recorded soundtracks for video games and movies, such as Looper.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Thorsteinson has a strong passion for music and is member of numerous ensembles. She performs currently in Ensemble Kaleïo, a dynamic woodwind quintet dedicated to bridging the gap between audiences and musicians. She gives her time to play for charities with l'Orchestre Symphonique de l'Agora, an orchestra started and conducted by Nicolas Ellis where all concert proceeds are donated to non-profit institutions such as the Montreal Children's Hospital, Equiterre and the Red Cross Lac-Mégantic Fund. A lover of contemporary music practices, she participates in numerous free-improvisation, and free-jazz ensembles and has played in various festivals including the Darmstadt International Music Festival ('14) as well as the OFF Jazz Festival ('14).</p>
