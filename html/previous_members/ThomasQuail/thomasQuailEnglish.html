		    <h3>THOMAS QUAIL</h3>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Quail is a violist based in Montreal. His music-making combines elements of classical, experimental, creative, and improvised music. He currently performs in a number of experimental ensembles, including the Erik Hove Large Ensemble, Chronicle Infinitas, and drummer/composer Chris McCann's project "Vie à musique". He has also performed and recorded with groups of all musical stripe, including Alden Penner's project (formerly of The Unicorns), the Montreal-based choir Concerto Della Donna, and the rapper The Narcicyst. He has performed at the Montreal Jazz Festival, Suoni Per Il Popolo, and Pop Montreal, and his performances have been broadcast on the CBC, Radio-Canada, and NPR.</p>
		    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From a classical chamber music perspective, he has performed alongside members of the London Haydn Quartet, the Chilingirian Quartet, and violist Steven Dann, and has participated in masterclasses and coachings with Irvine Arditti, the Miro String Quartet, Jaap ter Linden, Douglas McNabney and others. Notable orchestral experiences include two summers as principal violist of the National Youth Orchestra of Canada. Thomas honed his skills in Calgary, AB, before moving to Montreal — lessons and coachings with William van der Sloot, Nicholas Pulos, Gwen Hoebig, and Ian Swensen during his teen years were of particular influence on his musical development. He plays on a 1991 David Prentice viola.</p>
