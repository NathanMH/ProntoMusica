                    <h3>Mathilde Bernard</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathilde started playing the viola at the age of 5 at the Cergy-Pontoise Regional Concervatory (France) where she graduated in Laurent Bruni’s studio in 2005.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She then pursued her musical learning at the Paris Conservatory with Catherine Puig, while doing a Spanish Bachelor at the University Paris IV- La Sorbonne.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the age of 20, she was accepted unanimously at the National Superior Music and Dance Conservatory of Lyon (CNSMDL) where she obtained her BA in Jean-Philippe Vasseur’s studio. During these years, her passion for the orchestra was consolidated on a summer tour in Europe and Japan with the European Union Youth Orchestra (EUYO) under the direction of Vladimir Ashkenazy.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, she performed as a substitute violist for many ensembles, such as the Suisse Romande Orchestra , the Lyon Opera House and the Champs Elysées Orchestra, playing for renowned conductors as Philippe Herrreweghe , Kazushi Ono, Marek Janowski, Stefano Montanari, Donald Runnicles and Kirill Petrenko . Her tours gave her the opportunity to play in such prestigious hall as the Berlin Philharmonie, the Vienna Konzerthaus, the Victoria Hall in Geneva or the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her love for travelling incited her to go to study in Berlin for one semester with Wilfried Strehle, principal violist of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. When she came back in Lyon, Mathilde completed her Master degree at the CNSMDL in Françoise Gnéri’s studio where she graduated in 2012.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since September 2013, she is PhD candidate in viola interpretation by Jutta Puchhammer at the University of Montreal.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2014, she won the concerto competition of the Montreal Philharmonic Student Orchestra (MPSO ), which led her to perform as a guest soloist the Béla Bartók Viola Concerto at the Pierre Mercure Hall under the direction of Nicolas Ellis.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Later this spring 2015, she will be invited again as a soloist, this time to perform the Mozart’s Sinfonia Concertante, accompanied by the Orchestra of the Agora and maestro Nicolas Ellis. </p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathilde is recipient of the Excellence Award Grant from the University of Montreal, the Luc Vinet scholarship, the Musicology Cercle of UdeM scholarship and the Copibec scholarship.</p>
