	  <div class="sectionTitle">MISSION:</div>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Founded in 2013 by cellist Eli Weinberger, Pronto Musica is a non-profit organization with the goal of providing professional quality performance opportunities to promising young classical musicians who are transitioning between post-secondary studies and the professional world. Our goal is to create a full-time professional training orchestra in Canada.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <div class="sectionTitle">PROGRAM:</div>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The years which follow graduation can be challenging to those on the audition and freelancing circuits. As such, Pronto Musica seeks to aid emerging artists by creating performance opportunities for which they receive a stipend. Under the tutelage of Maestro Alexis Hauser, musicians are given the chance to refine their orchestral playing, to expand their knowledge of the orchestral repertoire and to work with esteemed soloists. They are also encouraged to form and promote their own chamber ensembles, allowing for the development of essential networking and entrepreneurial skills.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <div class="sectionTitle">WHO WE ARE:</div>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pronto Musica is generally comprised of musicians who have recently graduated from McGill University, the Montreal Conservatory, and the University of Montreal. In some cases, musicians in the final year of their undergraduate degree or musicians pursuing graduate level degrees are also accepted. Invited soloists are chosen principally from the music faculties of the aforementioned music schools, as well as from the Montreal Symphony Orchestra and other well-known musical organizations in the Montreal area. Whenever possible, Pronto Musica also seeks to collaborate with visiting artists.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <div class="sectionTitle">DONATE:</div>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pronto Musica is registered not-for-profit organization that strives to connect audiences with exceptional young players who are transitioning from academic to professional excellence. By supporting our musicians, one can make an investment not only into the future of these musicians, but also into the future of live classical music in Montreal.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pronto Musica is the ONLY orchestra in Canada which currently offers this type of professional development opportunity during the regular season. There is a great need for this kind of training and we hope to be able to provide it on a much larger scale in the near future. Every donation we receive will go directly to helping our organization to grow and to fulfill this mission.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="section">
	  <div class="sectionTitle">GET INVOLVED:</div>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pronto Musica is always looking for new members to join our administrative team. Are you interested in volunteering? Have experience with non-profit organizations?
