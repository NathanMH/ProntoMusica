	  <h3>PHILIP CHIU</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a summation of technical and musical abilities, pianist Philip Chiu has become one of Canada’s leading musicians through his infectious love of music and his passion for communication and collaboration. Lauded for the brilliance, colour and sensitivity of his playing, he is particularly noted for his ability to connect with audiences on and off-stage.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An exceedingly sociable pianist, Philip concertizes extensively as one of Canada's most sought-after chamber musicians. He has appeared in recitals with leading musicians of the world stage, including Regis Pasquier, James Ehnes, Raphael Wallfisch, Patrice Fontanarosa, Matt Haimovitz, Radovan Vlatkovic, Stefan Dohr, Philippe Bernold, Alex Klein, and Eugene Isotov. He performs regularly with principal members of Canada’s leading orchestras and ensembles, including Toronto Symphony Orchestra concertmaster Jonathan Crow (as part of the Crow­Chiu Duo), and l’Orchestre Symphonique de Montréal concertmaster Andrew Wan. Along with pianist Janelle Fung, he forms one of Canada’s most exciting piano duos, the Fung­Chiu Duo. He tours regularly with premier touring organizations, Jeunesses Musicales Canada, Debut Atlantic, and Prairie Debut.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dedicated to elevating the standard and art of collaborative piano, Philip is the creator and director of the new Collaborative Piano Program at the Domaine Forget International Festival and Academy.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip is the inaugural recipient of the Prix Goyer (2015-2016) - one of Canada’s largest classical music prizes, in recognition of his artistic achievements and contribution to Canadian classical music. He is also extremely grateful for the support of the Sylva Gelber Music Foundation, Canada Council for the Arts, and Jeunesses Musicales Canada. He can be heard/seen on Classical 96.3 FM, Australia’s ABC Radio, CBC Radio, and Radio​-Canada, and has recorded for Analekta and Espace XXI.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philip is represented by Andrew Kwan Artists Management.</p>
