Turning to classical music in 2007, he won the 1st Prize for Russian art song in the Open Competition for Youth, Hopes of Romansiada in Moscow. Igor holds Bachelors degree in Voice Performance from McGill Universitys Schulich School of Music where he studied under the guidance of Prof. Joanne Kolomyjec, Prof. Sanford Sylvan and Prof. Michael McMahon. Currently, Igor is pursuing a Masters degree at the Schulish School of Music under the guidance of Prof. Ben Heppner, Prof. Michael McMahon and Prof. Stephen Hargreaves.
