                    <h3>CLÉMENTINE CÔMES</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Paris, Clémentine Cômes started studying music at the age of six. She went on to complete studies in viola at the Conservatory of Toulouse and harpsichord at the Conservatory of Montauban. During this time she also began playing in chamber ensembles under the tutelage of Hubert Guéry and Christopher Waltham. A passionate chamber musician, she has been a member of several string quartets and performed a broad range of repertoire.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2009 she was the recipient of the Aïda Scholarship which enabled her to perform in a series of concerts with the Orchestre National du Capitole de Toulouse under the conductor Tugan Sokhiev. That same year she participated in the Festival Jazz in Marciac, performing with the Orchestre du Conservatoire National de Région de Toulouse alongside Milton Nascimento and the Belmondo brothers.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She is currently pursuing a master's degree under Jutta Puchhammer-Sédillot at the University of Montréal where she was awarded a scholarship of excellence.</p>
