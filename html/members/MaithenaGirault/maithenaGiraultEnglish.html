	  <h3>MA&Iuml;TH&Eacute;NA GIRAULT</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maïthéna Girault began playing the violin at the age of 6. Two years later, she was admitted to the Conservatoire de musique de Montréal where she spent 10 years under the tutelage of M. Helmut Lipsky. Since September 2014, she studies with Andrew Wan and Alexander Read at McGill University. Maïthéna took part in three tours in France with the Joseph-François Perrault Symphony Orchestra (2008, 2009, 2011), the last one as a soloist. Since then, she has performed concertos with multiple orchestras more than a dozen times. One of these concerts was broadcasted by Radio Ville-Marie. Through different collaborations, she played with the OSM and the Metropolitan Orchestra, working with Maestros Kent Nagano, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, Nathan Brock, Jean-François Rivest and Joshua Dos Santos. She sat concertmaster with orchestras in France, Germany, Italy, in the United States and in Montreal's Maison symphonique. Last May, she performed in Carnegie Hall both as a soloist and a chamber music player.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the years, Maïthéna has also had the chance to study with Pierre Amoyal, Rachel Barton-Pine, Martin Chalifour, Augustin Dumay, Patrice Fontanarosa, Rodney Friend, Micheal Frischenschlager, Régis Pasquier, Vadim Repin and many others. Maïthéna won first prizes in many competitions, including the Concours de musique du Canada, the Festival de musique du Royaume and the Concours de musique classique de Pierre-De Saurel. In 2013 and 2014, she was the grand winner of the MSYO Concerto Competition and Sandra Wilson Prize. Maïthéna is currently completing a Licentiate in Music diploma at the Schulich School of Music. Her violin is generously lent to her by Andrew Wan, a copy of his personal 1744 Michel'Angelo Bergonzi.</p>
