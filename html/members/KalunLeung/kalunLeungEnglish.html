	  <h3>KALUN LEUNG</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalun Leung is a graduate student and fellowship recipient in trombone performance at McGill University in Montreal. His groundbreaking research on Balkan brass band tradition was supported by a SSHRC grant where he explores the cross-pollination of oral and aural folk music traditions within a Western educational context. This intercultural curiosity has led Kalun to travel to unfamiliar musical communities such as to Ethno Bosnia-Herzegovina in the summer of 2014 where he was the only representative from North America amongst over 70 musicians from Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, and Montenegro. During this journey, Kalun hitchhiked to Guca in southern Serbia, the heart of Roma (gypsy) brass band tradition where he collaborated with members of the Bulgarian National Folklore Ensemble Philip Kutev. In the summer of 2015, Kalun was invited to conduct masterclasses in Lima, Peru. This opportunity led to an immersion in Peruvian folk and popular music, highlighted by a homestay with a mariachi musician and a performance in the Basilica Cathedral of Lima.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kalun currently leads the Montreal Salsa Collective and is a member of the folk-pop outfit Little Suns who are due to release their sophomore album Zero in fall 2015. As a sideman he has played with the Orchestra National de jazz de Montréal, the Juno award-winning Latin band Caché, and the composer Malcolm Sailor and his Big Band. He has held principal positions with the McGill Symphony Orchestra, Contemporary Music Ensemble, Jazz Orchestra, and Brass Quintet I. In 2015, he played solo euphonium with the Faculty Brass Ensemble of Domaine Forget alongside his mentors Jesper Busk Sorensen of the Berlin Philharmonic, Øystein Baadsvik, and his principal teacher Patrice Richer. He studied jazz improvisation with Remi Bolduc and Al Kay, and with Nitzan Haroz, Radovan Vlatkovic, and Gene Pokorny at the Summer Brass Institute at Menlo School where he participated as a full scholarship fellow in 2014.</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2010, Kalun received his Bachelors in Business Administration with honours from the internationally renowned Schulich School of Business in Toronto. He has worked in a marketing capacity with Jamie Oliver in promoting and launching his retail food line in Canada, and as a consultant for the Music Toronto Chamber series. He has been involved in various administrative roles with arts organizations such as the Canadian Opera Company, Mark Stephen Buhl Artist Management in Vienna, Universal Music Canada, and Jeunesses Musicale Ontario.</p>
