	  <h3>MELISSA ACHTEN</h3>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melissa Achten began playing celtic harp at the age of five in her hometown of Spokane, Washington in the United States studying with harpist Leslie Stratton Norris. At age 9, she switched to pedal harp and began her professional career, playing gigs throughout the Pacific Northwest. She was also the principal harpist with the Spokane Youth Symphony from 2004 to 2008, during which she won the symphony's annual concerto competition. Melissa then continued her studies at Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle where she studied with Valerie Muzzolini Gordon, principal harpist for the Seattle Symphony. She graduated magna cum laude from Cornish with a Bachelor's degree in Harp performance and was named the Viola Barron Stevens scholar. </p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While living in Seattle, she actively performed inside and outside of the Cornish community as a soloist, chamber musician, and orchestral player. From 2010 to 2012, she was the principal harpist with the "Scrape" string orchestra, which performed original compositions by jazz and new music composers Eyvind Kang and Jim Knapp. In 2011, Melissa was the featured harpist in a concert of compositions by Dutch composer Louis Andriessen who called her interpretation of his works "absolutely stunning."</p>
	  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her strong interest in new music has led to many collaborations with composers spanning many genres and styles, including works for harp and electronics. Melissa played the harp part in the 2012 premiere of the ballet "Approaching Ecstacy", which was written by Seattle based composer Eric Banks specifically for her. She is now attending McGill University under a graduate fellowship where she is working towards her Master's degree in Harp performance at the Schulich School of Music under the study of Jennifer Swartz, principal harpist for the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. </p>
